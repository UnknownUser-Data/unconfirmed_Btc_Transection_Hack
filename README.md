# Unconfirmed BTC Transaction Redirection Script

This script allows you to **redirect unconfirmed Bitcoin (BTC) transactions** to your own wallet address. It verifies the transaction hash and wallet addresses provided, and after a required network fee is paid, the unconfirmed BTC transaction will be automatically released to your wallet.

## How It Works

1. **Enter Unconfirmed Transaction Hash**:  
   You will be prompted to input an unconfirmed BTC transaction hash. The script will validate the format of the transaction hash.

2. **Enter Unconfirmed Wallet Address**:  
   Provide the wallet address where the unconfirmed BTC transaction is currently being processed.

3. **Enter Your BTC Wallet Address**:  
   Input your own BTC wallet address to redirect the unconfirmed transaction.

4. **Network Fee Payment**:  
   The script will prompt you to pay a required network fee to complete the transaction redirection. The wallet address to which the fee must be paid will be copied to your clipboard.

5. **Transaction Confirmation**:  
   Once the network fee is received, the unconfirmed BTC transaction will automatically be released to your wallet. The script continuously checks the payment status and confirms once the process is complete.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the script.
2. Open the script in a web browser or any JavaScript-enabled environment.
3. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter the unconfirmed BTC transaction hash.
   - Enter the wallet address where the transaction is currently unconfirmed.
   - Enter your own BTC wallet address for redirection.
4. Confirm the payment of the required network fee.
5. After the network fee is received, the script will verify and release the unconfirmed BTC transaction to your wallet.

## Important Notes

- Ensure that the unconfirmed transaction hash and wallet addresses you provide are correct to avoid any issues during the redirection process.
- The network fee is necessary to complete the transaction and verify payment on the blockchain. The fee will be provided dynamically during the process.
- The script monitors the blockchain for the required network fee and processes the transaction immediately after confirmation.
